# Start-WriteUp
Start-WriteUp is a script that was put together to help making write up tutorials for CTF challenges.  
By using the same template it will helps me stay consitent and create an more pleasing workflow.  

## Motivation
I got tired of scrambling to put together a write up.

## Framework
Buit with Powershell 5.1

## Examples

`Start-WriteUp.ps1 -name "Write up name" -dir C:\writeUp\Location -platefom "CTF Platform"`
